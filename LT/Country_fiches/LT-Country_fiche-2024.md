## Introduction

This country fiche highlights Lithuania’s progress in the various areas of INSPIRE implementation. It contains information covering the period **up to March 2024**.

Lithuania has transposed the INSPIRE Directive into national law by adopting amendments to the Law on Geodesy and Cartography (https://e-tar.lt/portal/lt/legalAct/TAR.EFE69222D6BC/asr). 

This law defines the Lithuanian spatial information infrastructure. Centralised spatial data sharing tools have been established on the Lithuanian Spatial Information Portal https://www.geoportal.lt/.  The content of the Lithuanian Spatial Information Portal is available in Lithuanian and English.  

The Lithuanian responsible authorities shall ensure the provision of spatial data sets included in the list approved by the Resolution of the Government of the Republic of Lithuania No 1460 of 13 October 2010 "On the approval of the spatial data themes of the Lithuanian Spatial Information Infrastructure" (https://e-tar.lt/portal/lt/legalAct/TAR.63D65F3568A2/asr) as well as of their metadata, to the INSPIRE geoportal of the European Commission (https://inspire-geoportal.ec.europa.eu);
Lithuania ensures the functioning of the Lithuanian Spatial Information Infrastructure tools and provision of spatial data and services to the INSPIRE geoportal in Lithuania. The national INSPIRE data system is accessible at: https://www.inspire-geoportal.lt/geonetwork/srv/eng/catalog.search#/home
