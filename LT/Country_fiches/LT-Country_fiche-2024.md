## Introduction

This country fiche highlights Lithuania’s progress in the various areas of INSPIRE implementation. It contains information covering the period **up to March 2024**.

Lithuania has transposed the INSPIRE Directive into national law by adopting amendments to the Law on Geodesy and Cartography (https://e-tar.lt/portal/lt/legalAct/TAR.EFE69222D6BC/asr). 

This law defines the Lithuanian spatial information infrastructure. Centralised spatial data sharing tools have been established on the Lithuanian Spatial Information Portal https://www.geoportal.lt/.  The content of the Lithuanian Spatial Information Portal is available in Lithuanian and English.  

The Lithuanian responsible authorities shall ensure the provision of spatial data sets included in the list approved by the Resolution of the Government of the Republic of Lithuania No 1460 of 13 October 2010 "On the approval of the spatial data themes of the Lithuanian Spatial Information Infrastructure" (https://e-tar.lt/portal/lt/legalAct/TAR.63D65F3568A2/asr) as well as of their metadata, to the INSPIRE geoportal of the European Commission (https://inspire-geoportal.ec.europa.eu);
Lithuania ensures the functioning of the Lithuanian Spatial Information Infrastructure tools and provision of spatial data and services to the INSPIRE geoportal in Lithuania. The national INSPIRE data system is accessible at: https://www.inspire-geoportal.lt/geonetwork/srv/eng/catalog.search#/home.

##### Coordination structure

Since 03-01-2023 the Ministry of the Environment is the designated governmental authority, responsible for the implementation of the INSPIRE Directive in the Republic of Lithuania (Ministry of Agriculture co-ordinated INSPIRE activities by 03-01-2023.). Ministry of Environment is responsible for the development of SDI measures to ensure operational capacities of metadata, data sets, network services, sharing services for the themes referred in the Annexes of the Directive. It also maintains the link to the INSPIRE portal. 

Ministry of Environment is responsible for:
- acting as a governmental representative in the INSPIRE Committee;
- monitoring the establishment and use of the spatial data infrastructure in Lithuania;
  - submitting reports on the implementation of the Directive in Lithuania to European Commission.

The Law on Geodesy and Cartography of the Republic of Lithuania is the principal law transposing the Directive to national legal framework in the Republic of Lithuania. Detailed requirements for the implementation of the INSPIRE Directive are laid down in Government Decrees of the Republic of Lithuania, Orders of the Minister of the Environment and other subordinate legal acts.

The Resolution of Lithuanian Government of 13 October, 2010, No. 1460 and its amendments (the latest amendment of 5 February 2025, https://e-tar.lt/portal/lt/legalAct/92867760e90c11ef8bf78f8ccc0e0474) sets the list of the datasets corresponding to Annexes of the Directive, which  shall be provided to users within Lithuanian spatial information infrastructure.

Lithuanian Spatial Information portal (LSI portal, www.geoportal.lt) is the main technological platform  implementing the provisions of the Directive. It provides the single national access point to spatial data and services. It is the primary source of national spatial data and services to the INSPIRE geoportal.

The operating (technical) manager of the LSI portal is Public Enterprise “Construction Sector Development Agency” (hereinafter CSDA). CSDA is responsible for:
- management of the systems of the LSI portal and ensuring a continuous operation of the services;
- content administration of the LSI portal;
- collection, arrangement and management of metadata;
- development and maintenance of the LSI portal web services;
- management of data license agreements;
- monitoring of the provision of spatial data and services;
- support and consultation of LSI portal users and data providers;
- ensuring security of LSI portal information;
- provision of spatial data and services to the INSPIRE geoportal.

The data providers are the state and municipal authorities and other legal persons, responsible for creation and management of spatial datasets. Any data provider (state or commercial, NGOs or physical persons) can share their spatial data in the LSI portal free of charge if the data are considered being valuable for the society.

In accordance to the procedure and under the conditions laid down by the Law on Geodesy and Cartography and the LSI Portal Regulation, the manager of the LSI portal maintains data provision agreements with the LSI portal spatial data providers.

Provision of spatial data and services to the INSPIRE geoportal is also regulated by data provision agreements. Data providers are responsible for transformations of spatial data according to the INSPIRE data specifications.  LSI portal manager is responsible for creating INSPIRE compliant metadata and network services of the datasets. LSI portal manager provides regular consultations on LSI portal benefits and organizes trainings on proper provision. 
Users of the services of the LSI portal are physical and legal persons who use the data of the LSI portal, spatial data sets and their metadata through the spatial data services and interactive e-services of the LSI portal.
